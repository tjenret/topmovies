## About

*For Informational Purposes Only*

This is a very small page designed to quickly show what is possible with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. The page uses a flat file containing all the movie data instead of making calls to an API.

## How to Use

Upon open, the web page displays the top 100 movies, sorted according to rank, highest to lowest. This sorting can be changed by selecting one of the sort options above the movie list. This is a dropdown menu on mobile and a radio button list on desktop. OPtions include:
  - Rank &uarr;
  - Rank &darr;
  - Year &uarr;
  - Year &darr;
  - Title (A-Z)
  - Title (Z-A)

Users can also search for a movie by typing its title, principal actors or director, year of release, or numerical ranking into the search bar.
